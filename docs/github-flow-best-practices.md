# GitHub Flow and Collaboration Best Practices

## Branching Strategy: Git Flow

### Branch Types and Purposes

#### `main` Branch
- Represents stable, production-ready code
- Only merged from `release` or `hotfix` branches
- Protected branch with strict merge requirements
- Always deployable to production

#### `develop` Branch
- Integration branch for ongoing development
- Receives merges from feature branches
- Serves as a staging area before production release
- Base branch for new feature development

#### `feature/[feature-name]` Branches
- Created for developing new features
- Branched from `develop`
- Naming convention: `feature/add-websocket-support`
- Merged back to `develop` via pull request

#### `bugfix/[bug-description]` Branches
- Used for fixing bugs in existing code
- Branched from `develop` or `main`
- Naming convention: `bugfix/authentication-memory-leak`
- Merged back to appropriate base branch

#### `release/[version]` Branches
- Prepared for new production release
- Created from `develop`
- Final testing and version bump
- Merged to both `main` and `develop`
- Naming convention: `release/v1.2.0`

#### `hotfix/[issue-description]` Branches
- Emergency fixes for production issues
- Branched directly from `main`
- Immediate critical bug fixes
- Merged to both `main` and `develop`

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Creation Process
1. Create branch from appropriate base branch
2. Write clear, descriptive title
3. Provide detailed description:
   - Purpose of changes
   - Related issues
   - Testing performed
4. Link related GitHub Issues

### Review Checklist
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Appropriate test coverage
- No unnecessary changes
- Documentation updated
- Performance considerations addressed

### Approval Requirements
- Minimum 1-2 approvals from team members
- All automated checks must pass
- No outstanding comments or requested changes

## Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow

### GitHub Actions Configuration
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop, main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop, main ]

jobs:
  backend-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up JDK
        uses: actions/setup-java@v2
      - name: Run Backend Tests
        run: ./mvnw test

  frontend-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Frontend Tests
        run: npm test

  code-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: SonarCloud Scan
        uses: sonarsource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
```

## Documentation Standards

### README Requirements
- Project overview
- Setup instructions
- Environment configuration
- Dependency list
- Contribution guidelines

### Code Documentation
- Javadoc for backend classes/methods
- JSDoc for frontend components
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Architecture decision records

## Collaboration Tools
- Slack/Teams for communication
- GitHub Projects for task tracking
- Regular standup meetings
- Shared documentation (Notion/Confluence)

## Security Considerations
- Use branch protections
- Require signed commits
- Implement secret management
- Regular dependency audits

## Recommended Tools
- GitHub Desktop
- VS Code Git Extensions
- GitKraken
- Sourcetree

## Workflow Best Practices
1. Pull latest changes before starting work
2. Create small, focused branches
3. Commit frequently with clear messages
4. Use conventional commit messages
5. Always review your own code before requesting review
